Collective Ransomware Output Corruption. It's designed to copy all the files in the current directory to your computer or cloud server using scp. The program then encrypts all the files 15 times over and deletes the key. The key will be saved to your local device. Be sure to make the necessary changes to the script before testing it. Make sure to only use this on computers you own or with the owner's permission. I am not responsible for any illegal usage.
